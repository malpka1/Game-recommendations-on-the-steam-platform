# Hybrid Recommendation System

This project aims to build a hybrid recommendation system by combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The project is divided into four main stages:

1. Data Preparation and Creation of a Unified Database for Recommendations
2. Creating a Collaborative Filtering Model Based on Ratings Using SVD
3. Creating a Content-Based Model Using TF-IDF on Metadata Tags
4. Creating a Hybrid Recommendation System by Combining Collaborative and Content-Based Models

This project successfully demonstrates the process of building a robust hybrid recommendation system by integrating collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models. The four key stages—data preparation, collaborative filtering using SVD, content-based filtering using TF-IDF, and hybrid model integration—collectively contribute to creating a system that provides accurate and personalized game recommendations to users. The hybrid approach effectively leverages the strengths of both methods, resulting in a more comprehensive and reliable recommendation system.
